# CAM-SDM

The attached R file presents example code that was used to learn the relationship between current observations of Opuntia ficus-indica and a range of selected bioclim predictor datasets. 
Using the biomod2 package (Thuiller et al. 2023), species distribution models were built and ensembled, prior to projecting under both current and proposed CMIP6-SSP scenarios. This is an example of the R script that was used to produce the datasets presented in Buckland et al. 2023. Drought-tolerant succulent plants as an alternative crop under future global warming scenarios in sub-Saharan Africa. GCB Bioenergy. 

Users are required to input their own mapped network locations into the script. 

For further assitance using the biomod2 package, it is recommended to visit the relevant GitHub page: https://github.com/biomodhub/biomod2/issues and online reference website:
